# Human_pose_estimation

Open the Pose estimation.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Install the mediapipe library using !pip install mediapipe opencv-python
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook cells are divided into sections for installing dependencies, making detections, determining joints, and calculating angles.
The code will process the input images or video stream to detect human figures and estimate their poses by identifying and analyzing key points and joints.
If the code includes a real-time video stream from a webcam or a video file, you will see the output in a new window displaying the pose estimation in action.
For real-time video processing, you can usually **terminate the video feed by pressing the 'q' key on your keyboard. **
